        <h1>About Dengue</h1>
        <p>Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease affecting millions of people worldwide
            Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne viral infection common in tropical and subtrop
            ical regions, causing symptoms like high fever, severe headache, and pain behind the eyes.
            It can also lead to muscle and joint pain, nausea, vomiting, and a rash. Most cases are mild,
            but some can develop into severe dengue, which is a medical emergency that can be fatal if untreated.
            There is no specific treatment for the mild form, but severe cases require immediate hospitalization.  
            Symptoms::
1.Fever: Abrupt onset of high fever. 
2.Headache: Severe headache, often with pain behind the eyes that worsens with eye movement. 
3.Pain: Severe muscle and joint pain, earning it the nickname "break-bone fever". 
4.Rash: A measles-like rash that appears on the chest and upper limbs. 
5.Other symptoms: Nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, and swollen glands. 

     Severe dengue ::
Warning signs: Some people with dengue develop severe dengue, which can lead to severe bleeding, low blood pressure, and organ failure. 
Symptoms of severe dengue: Severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, rapid breathing, bleeding gums or nose, and vomiting blood. 
Medical emergency: Seek immediate medical attention if you experience warning signs of severe dengue.        
            
           Prevention::
Mosquito protection: Use insect repellent, wear long sleeves and pants, and sleep under mosquito nets. 
Eliminate breeding grounds: Remove standing water around your home where mosquitoes can breed. 
Stay informed: Dengue is prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas; check health advisories if you are traveling. 
 
     Treatment::
Mild dengue: Supportive care such as rest, fluids, and pain relievers like acetaminophen can be used.
            Avoid aspirin and ibuprofen as they can increase bleeding risk.
Severe dengue: A medical emergency requiring immediate hospital care with IV fluids,
            oxygen support, and blood pressure management.
